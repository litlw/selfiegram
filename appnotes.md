## view controller

two seperate elements that interact with each other. they are divided into the logic and the dom.

Controller logic and code only initializes when a user interacts with it.

UI view controller - can be any of these types:

- UITableView controller - one direction (its a table)

- UICollectionView controller - two direction (it can be a table or a grid)

- OurViewController - custom

Container View Controllers - The stuff thats in the UI

- UITabBarController - the things at the bottom that help navigate the media

- UINavigationController - navigation menu thing from the side.

Modifying View Controllers

- Navigation
  - probably dont need to modify. just plug it in.
- Data VC
  - need to write it yourself.

### Notes at the end of class


** Google Design Sprint ** is a process developed at Google that’s based on the idea that user feedback is critical in building a great product. It is a focused design process that has 5 steps. The steps are typically broken down into separate day, but it does not have to be.

On the first day you try to understand the problem and talk to as many key stakeholders (potential users) as possible.
On the second day you work individually to come up with detailed solutions.
On the third day you work as a team to decide which solution from the previous day makes the most sense.
On the fourth day you build out the solution, using pen + paper, prototyping tools, or even Xcode.
On the fifth day, you show your solution to customers and figure out if everything is intuitive or see if you have missed any important feature.
You take this feedback and either do the design sprint again or go ahead and build your app with your new learnings.

Tools for Prototyping:
- Pen + Paper: All prototyping should first be done on pen + paper. The simple reason is that it is the fastest to do and if you don’t like it, no problem, throw it away.
- Sketch (paid): Is a tool for designers or wanna-be designers to layout every screen in your app. It is a great way to visualize how the app is going to look without even opening up Xcode. They even have an iOS template which allows you to copy/paste iOS assets into your own Artboard.

Sketch

Prototyping tools like Marvel app. Marvel is a freemium tool and there are other competitors. Once you have every screen in Sketch, you can export it to marvel and pick transitions between every screen. This will allow you give your app to potential users without writing a line of code.
Trello (free): What features should your app have? You can keep track of it in Excel, or GitHub issues etc. My favourite tool to use for this is Trello. It’s fun and easy to use. This is an example board for building an MVP https://trello.com/b/R6DSCtsw/building-an-mvp-barker
